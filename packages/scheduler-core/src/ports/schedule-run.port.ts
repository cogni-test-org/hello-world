/**
 * Module: `@ports/graph-run`
 * Purpose: Graph run repository port for the canonical run ledger.
 * Scope: Defines contract for run record persistence. Does not contain implementations.
 * Invariants:
 * - Per SINGLE_RUN_LEDGER: one table for all execution types (API, scheduled, webhook)
 * - UNIQUE(schedule_id, scheduled_for) WHERE schedule_id IS NOT NULL prevents duplicate scheduled runs
 * - Used by worker activities, not by schedule CRUD adapter
 * - actorId required on all methods for RLS SET LOCAL / audit trail
 * Side-effects: none (interface definition only)
 * Links: docs/spec/scheduler.md, docs/spec/unified-graph-launch.md, DrizzleGraphRunAdapter
