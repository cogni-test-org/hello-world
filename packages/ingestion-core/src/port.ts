/**
 * Module: `@cogni/ingestion-core/port`
 * Purpose: Port interfaces for activity source adapters — poll and webhook capabilities.
 * Scope: Pure interfaces. Does not contain implementations — those live in services/scheduler-worker/src/adapters/ingestion/.
 * Invariants:
 * - ADAPTERS_NOT_IN_CORE: This file defines PORTs (interfaces), not implementations.
 * - All adapter deps (octokit, discord.js) live in the adapter, never in this package.
 * - CAPABILITY_REQUIRED: DataSourceRegistration must have at least one of poll or webhook.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: docs/spec/attribution-ledger.md#source-adapter-interface
 * @public
