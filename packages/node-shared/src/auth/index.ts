/**
 * Module: `@shared/auth`
 * Purpose: Barrel export for shared auth types and pure helpers used across app and adapters.
 * Scope: Re-exports session identity types; does not implement runtime side effects.
 * Invariants: Pure re-export, no mutations, no environment access.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Notes: Keep aligned with session.ts definitions; expand when auth surface grows.
 * Links: shared/auth/session
