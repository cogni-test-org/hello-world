/**
 * Module: `@cogni/node-shared`
 * Purpose: Shared pure utilities, constants, observability helpers, and domain types for all node apps.
 * Scope: Pure library — no env vars, no framework deps, no heavy runtime deps (pino/prom-client/wagmi stay app-local). Does NOT contain app-local code (env, db, hooks, config server, wagmi, logger, metrics).
 * Invariants:
 *   - PURE_LIBRARY: No process lifecycle, no env vars, no framework deps
 *   - NO_SRC_IMPORTS: Never imports @/ or src/ paths
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: docs/spec/packages-architecture.md
 * @public
