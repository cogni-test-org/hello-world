/**
 * Module: `@cogni/node-shared/observability`
 * Purpose: Cross-cutting observability — events, context, log helpers, client logger.
 * Scope: Pure observability utilities. Does NOT include logger factory (makeLogger), metrics, or redact — those stay app-local.
 * Invariants: PURE_LIBRARY — no pino runtime, no prom-client runtime.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: docs/spec/packages-architecture.md
