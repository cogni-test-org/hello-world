/**
 * Module: `@contracts/work.items.delete.v1.contract`
 * Purpose: Operation contract for hard-deleting a work item via the operator API.
 * Scope: Provides Zod schema and types for work item delete wire format. Does not contain business logic.
 * Invariants:
 *   - Contract remains stable; breaking changes require new version
 *   - All consumers use z.infer types
 *   - HARD_DELETE: row is removed from work_items; recovery via dolt_revert on the deletion commit
 *   - AUTHOR_ATTRIBUTED: author handle embedded in the dolt_log commit message
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: /api/v1/work/items/[id] route, docs/spec/work-items-port.md
 * @internal
 */
