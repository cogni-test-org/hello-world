/**
 * Module: `@cogni/ai-core/context/run-context`
 * Purpose: Shared run context type for relay subscribers (billing, history, etc.).
 * Scope: Defines RunContext provided by RunEventRelay to subscribers. Does NOT implement functions.
 * Invariants:
 *   - SINGLE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH: This is the canonical definition; src/types re-exports
 *   - RELAY_PROVIDES_CONTEXT: Relay provides context to subscribers, not events
 *   - ingressRequestId is transport correlation only, NEVER for idempotency
 *   - runId + attempt form execution identity
 * Side-effects: none (types only)
 * Links: ai_runtime.ts (RunEventRelay), billing.ts (commitUsageFact), GRAPH_EXECUTION.md
 * @public
 */

/**
 * Run context provided by RunEventRelay to all subscribers.
 * Per RELAY_PROVIDES_CONTEXT: subscribers receive context from relay, not from events.
 *
 * This ensures:
 * - Events (UsageFact, AssistantFinal) remain executor-agnostic
 * - Transport concerns (ingressRequestId) don't leak into billing facts
 * - All subscribers have consistent run identity
