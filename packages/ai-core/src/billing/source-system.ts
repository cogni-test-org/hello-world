 * Module: `@cogni/ai-core/billing/source-system`
 * Purpose: Source system enum for billing attribution across executors.
 * Scope: Defines SOURCE_SYSTEMS const and SourceSystem type. Does NOT implement logic.
 * Invariants:
 *   - SINGLE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH: This is the canonical definition; src/types re-exports
 *   - Each adapter has exactly one source system for billing attribution
 * Side-effects: none (constants and types only)
 * Links: LANGGRAPH_SERVER.md, GRAPH_EXECUTION.md
