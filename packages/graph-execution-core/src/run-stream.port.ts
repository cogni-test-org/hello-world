/**
 * Module: `@cogni/graph-execution-core/run-stream`
 * Purpose: Streaming transport for graph run events (publish/subscribe via append-log).
 * Scope: Port interface for ephemeral event streaming between Temporal activities and SSE endpoints. Does not implement streaming logic.
 * Invariants:
 *   - REDIS_IS_STREAM_PLANE: Only ephemeral stream data, not durable state
 *   - PUMP_TO_COMPLETION_VIA_REDIS: Publisher pumps all events regardless of subscriber count
 *   - SSE_FROM_REDIS_NOT_MEMORY: Subscribers read from stream, not in-process memory
 * Side-effects: none (interface only)
 * Links: docs/spec/unified-graph-launch.md §7-10
 * @public
